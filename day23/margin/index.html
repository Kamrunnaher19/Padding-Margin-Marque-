            been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</div>

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
